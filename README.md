# RCInflator

### Oxford Edition

This is a copy of the JSFX script created by REAPER forum member RCJacH and modified significantly (including some corrections to the algorithms on Gearspace) by forum member Sai'ke to null against Sonnox Inflator in every setting excluding "band split mode" which has yet to be implemented. See the discussion at https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=256286. My contributions were to provide data for analysis, run null tests as well as match the slider limits and defaults to the original plugin.
